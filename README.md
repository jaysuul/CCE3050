MDX University CN Thesis

Hey there, my name is Jay and I'm currently working on my thesis at Middlesex University. I'm studying for a BSc in Computer Networking where my thesis title reads: 'An Attack on WPA & WPA2 - Developing Network Security in Wi-Fi Systems' in which I am to look into WPA2 and its vulnerabilities, as well as explore WPA3 and mention any future implementations which would benefit this progress from WPA2 to WPA3. I also want to take a look into the consequences of creating new security measures for WPA3, and whether they would have any backward effect onto WPA2, as users will gradually move to WPA3, it is important that WPA2 is not compromised in the process. I'm using a raspberry pi running on raspbian, as well as my laptop which has Kali Linux as an external OS (USB) to carry out any penetration testing. I also aim on configuring a router from sratch so as to have the project be more scientific. Anyone willing to help on this project is more than welcome, as I am a student and have a lot to learn. Kindly let me know if you are interested in helping out on this project.
